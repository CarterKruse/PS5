/**
 * Hidden Markov Model
 * To accomplish POS tagging, we will use a hidden Markov model. In an HMM, the states are things we do not see and are
 * trying to infer, and the observations are what we do see. Thus, the observations are words in a sentence and the states
 * are tags because the text we will observe is not annotated with its part of speech tag.
 * <p>
 * We will proceed through a model by moving from state to state, producing one observation per state. In this "bigram"
 * model, each tag depends on the previous tag. Then each word depends on the tag. We let "#" be the tag before the start
 * of the sentence.
 * <p>
 * An HMM is defined by its states (here parts of speech tags), transitions (here tag to tag, with weights), and observations
 * (here tag to word, with weights). Probabilities are computed for the tags: for each tag, the frequencies of the transitions
 * out are divided by the total number of transitions out, and the frequencies of the words it tags are divided by the total
 * number of words it tags.
